# Do racial composition and political climate influence U.S. health literacy?

##### Significance: In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes important to promote [health literacy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0884-z) at the population level to stem the spread of virus. However, not all behaviors that aims to contain the pandemic are welcome in the U.S. In fact, some types of behavior, such as wearing face masks, have been regarded as a stigma for certain [racial and ethnic groups](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-masks-racism-african-americans.html). Also, in some states there were [protesters publicly gathered](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/business/media/lockdown-protests-reporters.html) against the stay-at-home restrictions, which is a strategy to keep social distancing. COVID-19-related protective behavior is not only related to public health, but also tied to culture and politics.

In this post, I explore the associations between racial composition, political climate, and COVID-19-related behavior. I focus on three major behaviors: hand washing, face masks, and social distancing. Using survey and digital trace data, I show that people living in the U.S. are likely to pay attention to specific behavior based upon their living environments, such as racial compositions and political climates.

Figure 1 shows people’s interests on these three behaviors in the U.S. over a year. The higher the number of hits, the more popular the keyword. In February 2019, people began searching face masks when China reported more COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Social distancing became popular keyword after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced its [social distancing recommendations](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/smarter-living/coronavirus-social-distancing.html) in March. It is then in early April that people again searched face masks when CDC incorporated face masks as part of its [guideline](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html). Interesting, face masks was the most popular keyword during the pandemic compared to social distancing and hand washing. I suspect that this phenomenon might be associated with states racial composition.

Figure 2. shows an interesting pattern. Whereas the states which have larger White population becomes aware of all three protective behaviors, those which have larger Black population seems to search the terms less.  Asian population, in contrast, pay a lot of attention to face masks and social distancing. The results do not mean racial groups have difference individual preferences given we only have state-level data. However, they demonstrates that racial composition in a state may influence residents’ perception of risk and shape their online search behavior.

Political climate may also shape people’s perception of COVID-19 risk. Figure 3. illustrates how states’ political ideology correlates with online search. Compared to hand washing, face masks and social distancing are strongly negatively correlated with the proportion of conservative ideology in a state. That is, the more the residents hold conservative ideology, the less they search for keywords that include face masks and social distancing. It may explain why in some states, such as

How to explain the correlation between racial composition, political climate, and COVID-19-related web-search behavior? There are many hypotheses. First, racial groups have unequal access to internet or digital devices. Recent [survey reports](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/acs/acs-39.html) find that compared to White and Asian households, households with a Black householder were the least likely to own or use computers or other digital devices. Without devices that can connect to internet,  Black population may find it is difficult to find information related to COVID-19 and protective strategies.

Second, face masks is part of [cultural norms](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/politics/coronavirus-white-house-face-masks.html?searchResultPosition=1) for Asian population. Different from the U.S., many Asian countries see wearing face masks as an effective protective strategy to contain the spread of COVID-19. Exposing to the information from their original homes, Asian Americans or immigrants may be likely to search face masks as more as social distancing. In contrast, hand washing is more acceptable in the U.S. In fact, when the outbreak happened in January, most [opinions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/opinion/coronavirus-prevention-tips.html) in the U.S. argue that people did not need to wear face masks, but should wash their hands more frequently.  

Third, [recent studies](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/the-relation-between-media-consumption-and-misinformation-at-the-outset-of-the-sars-cov-2-pandemic-in-the-us/) found that Republicans or those who have conservative political views were more likely to believe conspiracy theory, which argues that the CDC was overemphasizing the severity of the virus and this theory aims to attach President Donald Trump. As a result, it makes sense to observe in those states which have more conservatives, residents searched all three protective behaviors suggested by the CDC much less.

Digital trace data provides us unprecedented opportunities to observe people’s behavior in large scale. Combining survey data and Google trends, I illustrate how racial composition and political climates may contribute to people’s interests in COVID-19-related behavior. It does not mean they are casual relationship since many other factors, such as local government’s policies, may change people’s health literacy and awareness. However, it is crucial to pay attention to racial and political contexts in the U.S. if we aims to contain the pandemic as early as possible.
